Overview \u00b6 This library contains 9 modules, each of which can be used independently within your existing codebase, or combined together for a complete train/test workflow. How loss functions work \u00b6 Using losses and miners in your training loop \u00b6 Let\u2019s initialize a plain TripletMarginLoss : from pytorch_metric_learning import losses loss_func = losses . TripletMarginLoss () To compute the loss in your training loop, pass in the embeddings computed by your model, and the corresponding labels. The embeddings should have size (N, embedding_size), and the labels should have size (N), where N is the batch size. # your training loop for i , ( data , labels ) in enumerate ( dataloader ): optimizer . zero_grad () embeddings = model ( data ) loss = loss_func ( embeddings , labels ) loss . backward () optimizer . step () The TripletMarginLoss computes all possible triplets within the batch, based on the labels you pass into it. Anchor-positive pairs are formed by embeddings that share the same label, and anchor-negative pairs are formed by embeddings that have different labels. Sometimes it can help to add a mining function: from pytorch_metric_learning import miners , losses miner = miners . MultiSimilarityMiner () loss_func = losses . TripletMarginLoss () # your training loop for i , ( data , labels ) in enumerate ( dataloader ): optimizer . zero_grad () embeddings = model ( data ) hard_pairs = miner ( embeddings , labels ) loss = loss_func ( embeddings , labels , hard_pairs ) loss . backward () optimizer . step () In the above code, the miner finds positive and negative pairs that it thinks are particularly difficult. Note that even though the TripletMarginLoss operates on triplets, it\u2019s still possible to pass in pairs. This is because the library automatically converts pairs to triplets and triplets to pairs, when necessary. Customizing loss functions \u00b6 Loss functions can be customized using distances , reducers , and regularizers . In the diagram below, a miner finds the indices of hard pairs within a batch. These are used to index into the distance matrix, computed by the distance object. For this diagram, the loss function is pair-based, so it computes a loss per pair. In addition, a regularizer has been supplied, so a regularization loss is computed for each embedding in the batch. The per-pair and per-element losses are passed to the reducer, which (in this diagram) only keeps losses with a high value. The averages are computed for the high-valued pair and element losses, and are then added together to obtain the final loss. Now here's an example of a customized TripletMarginLoss: from pytorch_metric_learning.distances import CosineSimilarity from pytorch_metric_learning.reducers import ThresholdReducer from pytorch_metric_learning.regularizers import LpRegularizer from pytorch_metric_learning import losses loss_func = losses . TripletMarginLoss ( distance = CosineSimilarity (), reducer = ThresholdReducer ( high = 0.3 ), embedding_regularizer = LpRegularizer ()) This customized triplet loss has the following properties: The loss will be computed using cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance. All triplet losses that are higher than 0.3 will be discarded. The embeddings will be L2 regularized. Using loss functions for unsupervised / self-supervised learning \u00b6 The TripletMarginLoss is an embedding-based or tuple-based loss. This means that internally, there is no real notion of \"classes\". Tuples (pairs or triplets) are formed at each iteration, based on the labels it receives. The labels don't have to represent classes. They simply need to indicate the positive and negative relationships between the embeddings. Thus, it is easy to use these loss functions for unsupervised or self-supervised learning. For example, the code below is a simplified version of the augmentation strategy commonly used in self-supervision. The dataset does not come with any labels. Instead, the labels are created in the training loop, solely to indicate which embeddings are positive pairs. # your training for-loop for i , data in enumerate ( dataloader ): optimizer . zero_grad () embeddings = your_model ( data ) augmented = your_model ( your_augmentation ( data )) labels = torch . arange ( embeddings . size ( 0 )) embeddings = torch . cat ([ embeddings , augmented ], dim = 0 ) labels = torch . cat ([ labels , labels ], dim = 0 ) loss = loss_func ( embeddings , labels ) loss . backward () optimizer . step () Highlights of the rest of the library \u00b6 For a convenient way to train your model, take a look at the trainers . Want to test your model's accuracy on a dataset? Try the testers . To compute the accuracy of an embedding space directly, use AccuracyCalculator .

Some algorithms require additional networks, data augmentations, learning rate schedules etc. The goal of the trainers module is to provide access to these type of metric learning algorithms. In general, trainers are used as follows: from pytorch_metric_learning import trainers t = trainers . SomeTrainingFunction ( * args , ** kwargs ) t . train ( num_epochs = 10 ) BaseTrainer \u00b6 All trainers extend this class and therefore inherit its __init__ arguments. trainers .

The base class does not require any specific keys. For example, you could provide an empty dictionary, in which case no optimization will happen. Or you could provide just an optimizer for your trunk_model. But most likely, you'll want to pass in: {\"trunk_optimizer\": trunk_optimizer, \"embedder_optimizer\": embedder_optimizer}. batch_size : The number of elements that are retrieved at each iteration. loss_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to loss functions. The required keys depend on the training method, but all methods are likely to require at least: {\"metric_loss\": loss_func}. mining_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to mining functions. Pass in an empty dictionary, or one or more of the following keys: {\"subset_batch_miner\": mining_func1, \"tuple_miner\": mining_func2} dataset : The dataset you want to train on. Note that training methods do not perform validation, so do not pass in your validation or test set. data_device : The device that you want to put batches of data on. If not specified, the trainer will put the data on any available GPUs. iterations_per_epoch : Optional. If you don't specify iterations_per_epoch : 1 epoch = 1 pass through the dataloader iterator. If sampler=None , then 1 pass through the iterator is 1 pass through the dataset. If you use a sampler, then 1 pass through the iterator is 1 pass through the iterable returned by the sampler. For samplers like MPerClassSampler or some offline mining method, the iterable returned might be very long or very short etc, and might not be related to the length of the dataset. The length of the epoch might vary each time the sampler creates a new iterable. In these cases, it can be useful to specify iterations_per_epoch so that each \"epoch\" is just a fixed number of iterations. The definition of epoch matters because there's various things like LR schedulers and hooks that depend on an epoch ending. loss_weights : A dictionary mapping loss names to numbers. Each loss will be multiplied by the corresponding value in the dictionary. If not specified, then no loss weighting will occur. If not specified, then the original labels are used. sampler : The sampler used by the dataloader. If not specified, then random sampling will be used. collate_fn : The collate function used by the dataloader. lr_scheduers : A dictionary of PyTorch learning rate schedulers. Your keys should be strings of the form <model>_<step_type> , where <model> is a key that comes from either the models or loss_funcs dictionary, and <step_type> is one of the following: \"scheduler_by_iteration\" (will be stepped at every iteration) \"scheduler_by_epoch\" (will be stepped at the end of each epoch) \"scheduler_by_plateau\" (will step if accuracy plateaus. This requires you to write your own end-of-epoch hook, compute validation accuracy, and call trainer.step_lr_plateau_schedulers(validation_accuracy) . Or you can use HookContainer .) Here are some example valid lr_scheduler keys: trunk_scheduler_by_iteration metric_loss_scheduler_by_epoch embedder_scheduler_by_plateau gradient_clippers : A dictionary of gradient clipping functions. Each function will be called before the optimizers. freeze_these : Optional. A list or tuple of the names of models or loss functions that should have their parameters frozen during training. These models will have requires_grad set to False, and their optimizers will not be stepped. freeze_trunk_batchnorm : If True, then the BatchNorm parameters of the trunk model will be frozen during training. label_hierarchy_level : If each sample in your dataset has multiple labels, then this integer argument can be used to select which \"level\" to use. This assumes that your labels are \"2-dimensional\" with shape (num_samples, num_hierarchy_levels). Leave this at the default value, 0, if your data does not have multiple labels per sample. dataloader_num_workers : The number of processes your dataloader will use to load data. data_and_label_getter : A function that takes the output of your dataset's __getitem__ function, and returns a tuple of (data, labels). If None, then it is assumed that __getitem__ returns (data, labels). dataset_labels : The labels for your dataset. Can be 1-dimensional (1 label per datapoint) or 2-dimensional, where each row represents a datapoint, and the columns are the multiple labels that the datapoint has. Labels can be integers or strings. This option needs to be specified only if set_min_label_to_zero is True. set_min_label_to_zero : If True, labels will be mapped such that they represent their rank in the label set. For example, if your dataset has labels 5, 10, 12, 13, then at each iteration, these would become 0, 1, 2, 3. You should also set this to True if you want to use string labels. In that case, 'dog', 'cat', 'monkey' would get mapped to 1, 0, 2. If True, you must pass in dataset_labels (see above). The default is False. end_of_iteration_hook : This is an optional function that has one input argument (the trainer object), and performs some action (e.g. logging data) at the end of every iteration. Here are some things you might want to log: trainer.losses : this dictionary contains all loss values at the current iteration. trainer.loss_funcs and trainer.mining_funcs : these dictionaries contain the loss and mining functions. All loss and mining functions in pytorch-metric-learning have an attribute called record_these . This attribute is a list of strings, which are the names of other attributes that are worth recording for the purpose of analysis. For example, the record_these list for TripletMarginLoss is [\"avg_embedding_norm, \"num_non_zero_triplets\"] , so at each iteration you could log the value of trainer.loss_funcs[\"metric_loss\"].avg_embedding_norm and trainer.loss_funcs[\"metric_loss\"].num_non_zero_triplets . To accomplish this programmatically, you can loop through record_these and use the python function getattr to retrieve the attribute value. If you want ready-to-use hooks, take a look at the logging_presets module . end_of_epoch_hook : This is an optional function that operates like end_of_iteration_hook , except this occurs at the end of every epoch, so this might be a suitable place to run validation and save models. To end training early, your hook should return the boolean value False. Note, it must specifically return False , not None , 0 , [] etc. For this hook, you might want to access the following dictionaries: trainer.models , trainer.optimizers , trainer.lr_schedulers , trainer.loss_funcs , and trainer.mining_funcs . If you want ready-to-use hooks, take a look at the logging_presets module . MetricLossOnly \u00b6 This trainer just computes a metric loss from the output of your embedder network.

The integer appended to \"classifier_\" represents the cascaded model that the classifier will be appended to. For example, if the dictionary has classifier_0 and classifier_2, then the 0th and 2nd cascaded models will have classifier_model_0 and classifier_model_2 appended to them. loss_funcs : Must have the following form: {\"metric_loss_%d\": metric_loss_func_%d} Optionally include key:values of the form \"classifier_loss_%d\": classifier_loss_func_%d.

UnsupervisedEmbeddingsUsingAugmentations \u00b6 This is an implementation of a general approach that has been used in recent unsupervised learning papers, e.g. Unsupervised Embedding Learning via Invariant and Spreading Instance Feature and Unsupervised Deep Metric Learning via Auxiliary Rotation Loss . The idea is that augmented versions of a datapoint should be close to each other in the embedding space. trainers . UnsupervisedEmbeddingsUsingAugmentations ( transforms , data_and_label_setter = None , * args , ** kwargs ) Parameters : transforms : A list of transforms. For every sample in a batch, each transform will be applied to the sample.

The base class does not require any specific keys. For example, you could provide an empty dictionary, in which case no optimization will happen. Or you could provide just an optimizer for your trunk_model. But most likely, you'll want to pass in: {\"trunk_optimizer\": trunk_optimizer, \"embedder_optimizer\": embedder_optimizer}. batch_size : The number of elements that are retrieved at each iteration. loss_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to loss functions. The required keys depend on the training method, but all methods are likely to require at least: {\"metric_loss\": loss_func}. mining_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to mining functions. Pass in an empty dictionary, or one or more of the following keys: {\"subset_batch_miner\": mining_func1, \"tuple_miner\": mining_func2} dataset : The dataset you want to train on. Note that training methods do not perform validation, so do not pass in your validation or test set. data_device : The device that you want to put batches of data on. If not specified, the trainer will put the data on any available GPUs. iterations_per_epoch : Optional. If you don't specify iterations_per_epoch : 1 epoch = 1 pass through the dataloader iterator. If sampler=None , then 1 pass through the iterator is 1 pass through the dataset. If you use a sampler, then 1 pass through the iterator is 1 pass through the iterable returned by the sampler. For samplers like MPerClassSampler or some offline mining method, the iterable returned might be very long or very short etc, and might not be related to the length of the dataset. The length of the epoch might vary each time the sampler creates a new iterable. In these cases, it can be useful to specify iterations_per_epoch so that each \"epoch\" is just a fixed number of iterations. The definition of epoch matters because there's various things like LR schedulers and hooks that depend on an epoch ending. loss_weights : A dictionary mapping loss names to numbers. Each loss will be multiplied by the corresponding value in the dictionary. If not specified, then no loss weighting will occur. If not specified, then the original labels are used. sampler : The sampler used by the dataloader. If not specified, then random sampling will be used. collate_fn : The collate function used by the dataloader. lr_scheduers : A dictionary of PyTorch learning rate schedulers. Your keys should be strings of the form <model>_<step_type> , where <model> is a key that comes from either the models or loss_funcs dictionary, and <step_type> is one of the following: \"scheduler_by_iteration\" (will be stepped at every iteration) \"scheduler_by_epoch\" (will be stepped at the end of each epoch) \"scheduler_by_plateau\" (will step if accuracy plateaus. This requires you to write your own end-of-epoch hook, compute validation accuracy, and call trainer.step_lr_plateau_schedulers(validation_accuracy) . Or you can use HookContainer .) Here are some example valid lr_scheduler keys: trunk_scheduler_by_iteration metric_loss_scheduler_by_epoch embedder_scheduler_by_plateau gradient_clippers : A dictionary of gradient clipping functions. Each function will be called before the optimizers. freeze_these : Optional. A list or tuple of the names of models or loss functions that should have their parameters frozen during training. These models will have requires_grad set to False, and their optimizers will not be stepped. freeze_trunk_batchnorm : If True, then the BatchNorm parameters of the trunk model will be frozen during training. label_hierarchy_level : If each sample in your dataset has multiple labels, then this integer argument can be used to select which \"level\" to use. This assumes that your labels are \"2-dimensional\" with shape (num_samples, num_hierarchy_levels). Leave this at the default value, 0, if your data does not have multiple labels per sample. dataloader_num_workers : The number of processes your dataloader will use to load data. data_and_label_getter : A function that takes the output of your dataset's __getitem__ function, and returns a tuple of (data, labels). If None, then it is assumed that __getitem__ returns (data, labels). dataset_labels : The labels for your dataset. Can be 1-dimensional (1 label per datapoint) or 2-dimensional, where each row represents a datapoint, and the columns are the multiple labels that the datapoint has. Labels can be integers or strings. This option needs to be specified only if set_min_label_to_zero is True. set_min_label_to_zero : If True, labels will be mapped such that they represent their rank in the label set. For example, if your dataset has labels 5, 10, 12, 13, then at each iteration, these would become 0, 1, 2, 3. You should also set this to True if you want to use string labels. In that case, 'dog', 'cat', 'monkey' would get mapped to 1, 0, 2. If True, you must pass in dataset_labels (see above). The default is False. end_of_iteration_hook : This is an optional function that has one input argument (the trainer object), and performs some action (e.g. logging data) at the end of every iteration. Here are some things you might want to log: trainer.losses : this dictionary contains all loss values at the current iteration. trainer.loss_funcs and trainer.mining_funcs : these dictionaries contain the loss and mining functions. All loss and mining functions in pytorch-metric-learning have an attribute called record_these . This attribute is a list of strings, which are the names of other attributes that are worth recording for the purpose of analysis. For example, the record_these list for TripletMarginLoss is [\"avg_embedding_norm, \"num_non_zero_triplets\"] , so at each iteration you could log the value of trainer.loss_funcs[\"metric_loss\"].avg_embedding_norm and trainer.loss_funcs[\"metric_loss\"].num_non_zero_triplets . To accomplish this programmatically, you can loop through record_these and use the python function getattr to retrieve the attribute value. If you want ready-to-use hooks, take a look at the logging_presets module . end_of_epoch_hook : This is an optional function that operates like end_of_iteration_hook , except this occurs at the end of every epoch, so this might be a suitable place to run validation and save models. To end training early, your hook should return the boolean value False. Note, it must specifically return False , not None , 0 , [] etc. For this hook, you might want to access the following dictionaries: trainer.models , trainer.optimizers , trainer.lr_schedulers , trainer.loss_funcs , and trainer.mining_funcs .

In general, trainers are used as follows: from pytorch_metric_learning import trainers t = trainers . SomeTrainingFunction ( ** kwargs ) t . train () BaseTrainer \u00b6 All trainers extend this class and therefore inherit its __init__ arguments. trainers . BaseTrainer ( models , optimizers , batch_size , loss_funcs , mining_funcs , iterations_per_epoch , dataset , data_device = None , loss_weights = None , sampler = None , collate_fn = None , lr_schedulers = None , gradient_clippers = None , freeze_trunk_batchnorm = False , label_hierarchy_level = 0 , dataloader_num_workers = 32 , data_and_label_getter = None , dataset_labels = None , set_min_label_to_zero = False , end_of_iteration_hook = None , end_of_epoch_hook = None ) Parameters : models : A dictionary of the form: {\"trunk\": trunk_model, \"embedder\": embedder_model} optimizers : A dictionary mapping strings to optimizers. The base class does not require any specific keys. For example, you could provide an empty dictionary, in which case no optimization will happen. Or you could provide just an optimizer for your trunk_model. But most likely, you'll want to pass in: {\"trunk_optimizer\": trunk_optimizer, \"embedder_optimizer\": embedder_optimizer}. batch_size : The number of elements that are retrieved at each iteration. loss_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to loss functions. The required keys depend on the training method, but all methods are likely to require at least: {\"metric_loss\": loss_func}. mining_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to mining functions. Pass in an empty dictionary, or one or more of the following keys: {\"pre_gradient_miner\": mining_func1, \"post_gradient_miner\": mining_func2} iterations_per_epoch : In this library, epochs are just a measure of the number of iterations that have passed. So iterations_per_epoch is what actually defines what an \"epoch\" is. dataset : The dataset you want to train on. Note that training methods do not perform validation, so do not pass in your validation or test set. data_device : The device that you want to put batches of data on. If not specified, the trainer will put the data on any available GPUs. loss_weights : A dictionary mapping loss names to numbers. Each loss will be multiplied by the corresponding value in the dictionary. If not specified, then no loss weighting will occur. If not specified, then the original labels are used. sampler : The sampler used by the dataloader. If not specified, then random sampling will be used. collate_fn : The collate function used by the dataloader. lr_scheduers : A dictionary of PyTorch learning rate schedulers. Each scheduler will be stepped at the end of every epoch. gradient_clippers : A dictionary of gradient clipping functions. Each function will be called before the optimizers. freeze_trunk_batchnorm : If True, then the BatchNorm parameters of the trunk model will be frozen during training. label_hierarchy_level : If each sample in your dataset has multiple labels, then this integer argument can be used to select which \"level\" to use. This assumes that your labels are \"2-dimensional\" with shape (num_samples, num_hierarchy_levels). Leave this at the default value, 0, if your data does not have multiple labels per sample. dataloader_num_workers : The number of processes your dataloader will use to load data. data_and_label_getter : A function that takes the output of your dataset's __getitem__ function, and returns a tuple of (data, labels). If None, then it is assumed that __getitem__ returns (data, labels). dataset_labels : The labels for your dataset. Can be 1-dimensional (1 label per datapoint) or 2-dimensional, where each row represents a datapoint, and the columns are the multiple labels that the datapoint has. This option needs to be specified only if set_min_label_to_zero is True. set_min_label_to_zero : If True, labels will be mapped such that they represent their rank in the label set. For example, if your dataset has labels 5, 10, 12, 13, then at each iteration, these would become 0, 1, 2, 3. The default is False. end_of_iteration_hook : This is an optional function that has one input argument (the trainer object), and performs some action (e.g. logging data) at the end of every iteration. Here are some things you might want to log: trainer.losses : this dictionary contains all loss values at the current iteration. trainer.loss_funcs and trainer.mining_funcs : these dictionaries contain the loss and mining functions. All loss and mining functions in pytorch-metric-learning have an attribute called record_these . This attribute is a list of strings, which are the names of other attributes that are worth recording for the purpose of analysis. For example, the record_these list for TripletMarginLoss is [\"avg_embedding_norm, \"num_non_zero_triplets\"] , so at each iteration you could log the value of trainer.loss_funcs[\"metric_loss\"].avg_embedding_norm and trainer.loss_funcs[\"metric_loss\"].num_non_zero_triplets . To accomplish this programmatically, you can loop through record_these and use the python function getattr to retrieve the attribute value. If you want ready-to-use hooks, take a look at the logging_presets module . end_of_epoch_hook : This is an optional function that operates like end_of_iteration_hook , except this occurs at the end of every epoch, so this might be a suitable place to run validation and save models. To end training early, your hook should return the boolean value False. Note, it must specifically return False , not None , 0 , [] etc. For this hook, you might want to access the following dictionaries: trainer.models , trainer.optimizers , trainer.lr_schedulers , trainer.loss_funcs , and trainer.mining_funcs . If you want ready-to-use hooks, take a look at the logging_presets module . MetricLossOnly \u00b6 This trainer just computes a metric loss from the output of your embedder network. trainers .

For example, if the dictionary has classifier_0 and classifier_2, then the 0th and 2nd cascaded models will have classifier_model_0 and classifier_model_2 appended to them. loss_funcs : Must have the following form: {\"metric_loss_%d\": metric_loss_func_%d} Optionally include key:values of the form \"classifier_loss_%d\": classifier_loss_func_%d.

UnsupervisedEmbeddingsUsingAugmentations \u00b6 This is an implementation of a general approach that has been used in recent unsupervised learning papers, e.g. Unsupervised Embedding Learning via Invariant and Spreading Instance Feature and Unsupervised Deep Metric Learning via Auxiliary Rotation Loss . The idea is that augmented versions of a datapoint should be close to each other in the embedding space. trainers .

The base class does not require any specific keys. For example, you could provide an empty dictionary, in which case no optimization will happen. Or you could provide just an optimizer for your trunk_model. But most likely, you'll want to pass in: {\"trunk_optimizer\": trunk_optimizer, \"embedder_optimizer\": embedder_optimizer}. batch_size : The number of elements that are retrieved at each iteration. loss_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to loss functions. The required keys depend on the training method, but all methods are likely to require at least: {\"metric_loss\": loss_func}. mining_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to mining functions. Pass in an empty dictionary, or one or more of the following keys: {\"pre_gradient_miner\": mining_func1, \"post_gradient_miner\": mining_func2} iterations_per_epoch : In this library, epochs are just a measure of the number of iterations that have passed. So _iterations_per_epoch is what actually defines what an \"epoch\" is. dataset : The dataset you want to train on.

If not specified, the trainer will put the data on any available GPUs. loss_weights : A dictionary mapping loss names to numbers. Each loss will be multiplied by the corresponding value in the dictionary. If not specified, then no loss weighting will occur.

Each scheduler will be stepped at the end of every epoch. gradient_clippers : A dictionary of gradient clipping functions. Each function will be called before the optimizers. freeze_trunk_batchnorm : If True, then the BatchNorm parameters of the trunk model will be frozen during training. label_hierarchy_level : If each sample in your dataset has multiple labels, then this integer argument can be used to select which \"level\" to use. This assumes that your labels are \"2-dimensional\" with shape (num_samples, num_hierarchy_levels). dataloader_num_workers : The number of processes your dataloader will use to load data. data_and_label_getter : A function that takes the output of your dataset's __getitem__ function, and returns a tuple of (data, labels). If None, then it is assumed that __getitem__ returns (data, labels). dataset_labels : The labels for your dataset.

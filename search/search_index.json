Overview \u00b6 This library contains 9 modules, each of which can be used independently within your existing codebase, or combined together for a complete train/test workflow. How loss functions work \u00b6 Using losses and miners in your training loop \u00b6 Let\u2019s initialize a plain TripletMarginLoss : from pytorch_metric_learning import losses loss_func = losses . TripletMarginLoss () To compute the loss in your training loop, pass in the embeddings computed by your model, and the corresponding labels. The embeddings should have size (N, embedding_size), and the labels should have size (N), where N is the batch size. # your training loop for i , ( data , labels ) in enumerate ( dataloader ): optimizer . zero_grad () embeddings = model ( data ) loss = loss_func ( embeddings , labels ) loss . backward () optimizer . step () The TripletMarginLoss computes all possible triplets within the batch, based on the labels you pass into it. Anchor-positive pairs are formed by embeddings that share the same label, and anchor-negative pairs are formed by embeddings that have different labels. Sometimes it can help to add a mining function: from pytorch_metric_learning import miners , losses miner = miners . MultiSimilarityMiner () loss_func = losses . TripletMarginLoss () # your training loop for i , ( data , labels ) in enumerate ( dataloader ): optimizer . zero_grad () embeddings = model ( data ) hard_pairs = miner ( embeddings , labels ) loss = loss_func ( embeddings , labels , hard_pairs ) loss . backward () optimizer . step () In the above code, the miner finds positive and negative pairs that it thinks are particularly difficult. Note that even though the TripletMarginLoss operates on triplets, it\u2019s still possible to pass in pairs. This is because the library automatically converts pairs to triplets and triplets to pairs, when necessary. Customizing loss functions \u00b6 Loss functions can be customized using distances , reducers , and regularizers . In the diagram below, a miner finds the indices of hard pairs within a batch. These are used to index into the distance matrix, computed by the distance object. For this diagram, the loss function is pair-based, so it computes a loss per pair. In addition, a regularizer has been supplied, so a regularization loss is computed for each embedding in the batch. The per-pair and per-element losses are passed to the reducer, which (in this diagram) only keeps losses with a high value. The averages are computed for the high-valued pair and element losses, and are then added together to obtain the final loss. Now here's an example of a customized TripletMarginLoss: from pytorch_metric_learning.distances import CosineSimilarity from pytorch_metric_learning.reducers import ThresholdReducer from pytorch_metric_learning.regularizers import LpRegularizer from pytorch_metric_learning import losses loss_func = losses . TripletMarginLoss ( distance = CosineSimilarity (), reducer = ThresholdReducer ( high = 0.3 ), embedding_regularizer = LpRegularizer ()) This customized triplet loss has the following properties: The loss will be computed using cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance. All triplet losses that are higher than 0.3 will be discarded. The embeddings will be L2 regularized. Using loss functions for unsupervised / self-supervised learning \u00b6 A SelfSupervisedLoss wrapper is provided for self-supervised learning: from pytorch_metric_learning.losses import SelfSupervisedLoss loss_func = SelfSupervisedLoss ( TripletMarginLoss ()) # your training for-loop for i , data in enumerate ( dataloader ): optimizer . zero_grad () embeddings = your_model ( data ) augmented = your_model ( your_augmentation ( data )) loss = loss_func ( embeddings , augmented ) loss . backward () optimizer . step () If you're interested in MoCo -style self-supervision, take a look at the MoCo on CIFAR10 notebook. It uses CrossBatchMemory to implement the momentum encoder queue, which means you can use any tuple loss, and any tuple miner to extract hard samples from the queue. Highlights of the rest of the library \u00b6 For a convenient way to train your model, take a look at the trainers . Want to test your model's accuracy on a dataset? Try the testers . To compute the accuracy of an embedding space directly, use AccuracyCalculator . If you're short of time and want a complete train/test workflow, check out the example Google Colab notebooks .

It can be easily extended to create custom accuracy metrics. from pytorch_metric_learning.utils.accuracy_calculator import AccuracyCalculator AccuracyCalculator ( include = (), exclude = (), avg_of_avgs = False , return_per_class = False , k = None , label_comparison_fn = None , device = None , knn_func = None , kmeans_func = None ) Parameters \u00b6 include : Optional. A list or tuple of strings, which are the names of metrics you want to calculate. If left empty, all default metrics will be calculated. exclude : Optional. A list or tuple of strings, which are the names of metrics you do not want to calculate. avg_of_avgs : If True, the average accuracy per class is computed, and then the average of those averages is returned. This can be useful if your dataset has unbalanced classes. If False, the global average will be returned. return_per_class : If True, the average accuracy per class is computed and returned. k : The number of nearest neighbors that will be retrieved for metrics that require k-nearest neighbors. The allowed values are: None . This means k will be set to the total number of reference embeddings. An integer greater than 0. This means k will be set to the input integer. \"max_bin_count\" . This means k will be set to max(bincount(reference_labels)) - self_count where self_count == 1 if the query and reference embeddings come from the same source. label_comparison_fn : A function that compares two torch arrays of labels and returns a boolean array. The default is torch.eq . If a custom function is used, then you must exclude clustering based metrics (\"NMI\" and \"AMI\"). The example below shows a custom function for two-dimensional labels. It returns True if the 0th column matches, and the 1st column does not match. device : The device to move input tensors to. If None , will default to GPUs if available. knn_func : A callable that takes in 4 arguments ( query, k, reference, ref_includes_query ) and returns distances, indices . Default is pytorch_metric_learning.utils.inference.FaissKNN . kmeans_func : A callable that takes in 2 arguments ( x, nmb_clusters ) and returns a 1-d tensor of cluster assignments.

For each query sample, nearest neighbors are retrieved and accuracy is computed. query_labels : A 1D torch or numpy array of size (Nq) . Each element should be an integer representing the sample's label. reference : A 2D torch or numpy array of size (Nr, D) , where Nr is the number of reference samples. This is where nearest neighbors are retrieved from. reference_labels : A 1D torch or numpy array of size (Nr) . Each element should be an integer representing the sample's label. ref_includes_query : Set to True if query is a subset of reference or if query is reference . Set to False otherwise. include : Optional. A list or tuple of strings, which are the names of metrics you want to calculate. If left empty, all metrics specified during initialization will be calculated. exclude : Optional. A list or tuple of strings, which are the names of metrics you do not want to calculate. Note that labels can be 2D if a custom label comparison function is used. Lone query labels \u00b6 If some query labels don't appear in the reference set, then it's impossible for those labels to have non-zero k-nn accuracy. Zero accuracy for these labels doesn't indicate anything about the quality of the embedding space. So these lone query labels are excluded from k-nn based accuracy calculations. For example, if the input query_labels is [0,0,1,1] and reference_labels is [1,1,1,2,2] , then 0 is considered a lone query label. CPU/GPU usage \u00b6 If you installed faiss-cpu then the CPU will always be used. If you installed faiss-gpu , then the GPU will be used if k <= 1024 for CUDA < 9.5, and k <= 2048 for CUDA >= 9.5. If this condition is not met, then the CPU will be used. If your dataset is large, you might find the k-nn search is very slow. This is because the default behavior is to set k to len(reference_embeddings) . To avoid this, you can set k to a number, like k = 1000 , or try k = \"max_bin_count\" .

You can extend the existing class, and write methods that start with the keyword calculate_ from pytorch_metric_learning.utils import accuracy_calculator class YourCalculator ( accuracy_calculator . AccuracyCalculator ): def calculate_precision_at_2 ( self , knn_labels , query_labels , ** kwargs ): return accuracy_calculator . precision_at_k ( knn_labels , query_labels [:, None ], 2 ) def calculate_fancy_mutual_info ( self , query_labels , cluster_labels , ** kwargs ): return fancy_computations def requires_clustering ( self ): return super () . requires_clustering () + [ \"fancy_mutual_info\" ] def requires_knn ( self ): return super () . requires_knn () + [ \"precision_at_2\" ] Any method that starts with \"calculate_\" will be passed the following kwargs: kwargs = { \"query\" : query , # query embeddings \"reference\" : reference , # reference embeddings \"query_labels\" : query_labels , \"reference_labels\" : reference_labels , \"ref_includes_query\" : e } # True if query is reference, or if query is a subset of reference. If your method requires a k-nearest neighbors search, then append your method's name to the requires_knn list, as shown in the above example. If any of your accuracy methods require k-nearest neighbors, they will also receive the following kwargs: { \"label_counts\" : label_counts , # A dictionary mapping from reference labels to the number of times they occur \"knn_labels\" : knn_labels , # A 2d array where each row is the labels of the nearest neighbors of each query. The neighbors are retrieved from the reference set \"knn_distances\" : knn_distances # The euclidean distance corresponding to each k-nearest neighbor in knn_labels \"lone_query_labels\" : lone_query_labels # The set of labels (in the form of a torch array) that have only 1 occurrence in reference_labels \"not_lone_query_mask\" : not_lone_query_mask } # A boolean mask, where True means that a query element has at least 1 possible neighbor in reference. If your method requires cluster labels, then append your method's name to the requires_clustering list, as shown in the above example. Then, if any of your methods need cluster labels, self.get_cluster_labels() will be called, and the kwargs will include: { \"cluster_labels\" : cluster_labels } # A 1D array with a cluster label for each element in the query embeddings. Now when get_accuracy is called, the returned dictionary will contain precision_at_2 and fancy_mutual_info : calculator = YourCalculator () acc_dict = calculator . get_accuracy ( query_embeddings , query_labels , reference_embeddings , reference_labels , ref_includes_query = True ) # Now acc_dict contains the metrics \"precision_at_2\" and \"fancy_mutual_info\" # in addition to the original metrics from AccuracyCalculator You can use your custom calculator with the tester classes as well, by passing it in as an init argument.

For example, the ContrastiveLoss computes a loss for every positive and negative pair in a batch. A reducer will take all these per-pair losses, and reduce them to a single value. Here's where reducers fit in this library's flow of filters and computations: Your Data --> Sampler --> Miner --> Loss --> Reducer --> Final loss value Reducers are passed into loss functions like this: from pytorch_metric_learning import losses , reducers reducer = reducers . SomeReducer () loss_func = losses . SomeLoss ( reducer = reducer ) loss = loss_func ( embeddings , labels ) # in your training for-loop Internally, the loss function creates a dictionary that contains the losses and other information. The reducer takes this dictionary, performs the reduction, and returns a single value on which .backward() can be called. Most reducers are written such that they can be passed into any loss function. AvgNonZeroReducer \u00b6 This computes the average loss, using only the losses that are greater than 0. For example, if the losses are [0, 2, 0, 3] , then this reducer will return 2.5 . reducers . AvgNonZeroReducer ( ** kwargs ) This class is equivalent to using ThresholdReducer(low=0) . See ThresholdReducer . BaseReducer \u00b6 All reducers extend this class. reducers . BaseReducer ( collect_stats = False ) Parameters : collect_stats : If True, will collect various statistics that may be useful to analyze during experiments. If False, these computations will be skipped. Want to make True the default? Set the global COLLECT_STATS flag. ClassWeightedReducer \u00b6 This multiplies each loss by a class weight, and then takes the average. reducers . ClassWeightedReducer ( weights , ** kwargs ) Parameters : weights : A tensor of weights, where weights[i] is the weight for the ith class. DivisorReducer \u00b6 This divides each loss by a custom value specified inside the loss function. This is useful if you want to hardcode a reduction behavior in your loss function (i.e. by using DivisorReducer), while still having the option to use other reducers. reducers . DivisorReducer ( ** kwargs ) To use this reducer, the loss function must include divisor in its loss dictionary. For example, the ProxyAnchorLoss uses DivisorReducer by default, and returns the following dictionary: loss_dict = { \"pos_loss\" : { \"losses\" : pos_term . squeeze ( 0 ), \"indices\" : loss_indices , \"reduction_type\" : \"element\" , \"divisor\" : len ( with_pos_proxies ), }, \"neg_loss\" : { \"losses\" : neg_term . squeeze ( 0 ), \"indices\" : loss_indices , \"reduction_type\" : \"element\" , \"divisor\" : self . num_classes , }, } DoNothingReducer \u00b6 This returns its input.

Each reducer is applied to a different sub-loss, as specified in the host loss function. Then the reducer outputs are summed to obtain the final loss. reducers .

The strings must match sub-loss names of the host loss function. default_reducer : This reducer will be used for any sub-losses that are not included in the keys of reducers . If None, then MeanReducer() will be the default. Example usage : The ContrastiveLoss has two sub-losses: pos_loss for the positive pairs, and neg_loss for the negative pairs. In this example, a ThresholdReducer is used for the pos_loss and a MeanReducer is used for the neg_loss . from pytorch_metric_learning.losses import ContrastiveLoss from pytorch_metric_learning.reducers import MultipleReducers , ThresholdReducer , MeanReducer reducer_dict = { \"pos_loss\" : ThresholdReducer ( 0.1 ), \"neg_loss\" : MeanReducer ()} reducer = MultipleReducers ( reducer_dict ) loss_func = ContrastiveLoss ( reducer = reducer ) PerAnchorReducer \u00b6 This converts unreduced pairs to unreduced elements. For example, NTXentLoss returns losses per positive pair.

You'll see something like this: { \"train\" : { \"AMI_level0\" : 0.53 , ... }, \"val\" : { \"AMI_level0\" : 0.44 , ... }} Each of the accuracy metric names is appended with level0 , which refers to the 0th label hierarchy level (see the documentation for BaseTester ). This is only relevant if you're dealing with multi-label datasets. For an explanation of the default accuracy metrics, see the AccuracyCalculator documentation . Testing splits \u00b6 By default, every dataset in dataset_dict will be evaluated using itself as the query and reference (on which to find nearest neighbors). More flexibility is allowed with the optional argument splits_to_eval taken by tester.test() . splits_to_eval is a list of (query_split, [list_of_reference_splits]) tuples. For example, let's say your dataset_dict has two keys: \"dataset_a\" and \"train\" . The default splits_to_eval = None is equivalent to: splits_to_eval = [( 'dataset_a' , [ 'dataset_a' ]), ( 'train' , [ 'train' ])] dataset_a as the query, and train as the reference: splits_to_eval = [( 'dataset_a' , [ 'train' ])] dataset_a as the query, and dataset_a + train as the reference: splits_to_eval = [( 'dataset_a' , [ 'dataset_a' , 'train' ])] BaseTester \u00b6 All trainers extend this class and therefore inherit its __init__ arguments. testers .

The default is None, meaning PCA will not be applied. data_device : Which gpu to use for the loaded dataset samples. If None, then the gpu or cpu will be used (whichever is available). dtype : The type that the dataset output will be converted to, e.g. torch.float16 . If set to None , then no type casting will be done. data_and_label_getter : A function that takes the output of your dataset's __getitem__ function, and returns a tuple of (data, labels). If None, then it is assumed that __getitem__ returns (data, labels). label_hierarchy_level : If each sample in your dataset has multiple labels, then this integer argument can be used to select which \"level\" to use. This assumes that your labels are \"2-dimensional\" with shape (num_samples, num_hierarchy_levels). Leave this at the default value, 0, if your data does not have multiple labels per sample. end_of_testing_hook : This is an optional function that has one input argument (the tester object) and performs some action (e.g. logging data) at the end of testing. You'll probably want to access the accuracy metrics, which are stored in tester.all_accuracies . This is a nested dictionary with the following format: tester.all_accuracies[split_name][metric_name] = metric_value If you want ready-to-use hooks, take a look at the logging_presets module . dataset_labels : The labels for your dataset. Can be 1-dimensional (1 label per datapoint) or 2-dimensional, where each row represents a datapoint, and the columns are the multiple labels that the datapoint has. Labels can be integers or strings. This option needs to be specified only if set_min_label_to_zero is True. set_min_label_to_zero : If True, labels will be mapped such that they represent their rank in the label set. For example, if your dataset has labels 5, 10, 12, 13, then at each iteration, these would become 0, 1, 2, 3. You should also set this to True if you want to use string labels. In that case, 'dog', 'cat', 'monkey' would get mapped to 1, 0, 2. If True, you must pass in dataset_labels (see above). The default is False. accuracy_calculator : Optional. An object that extends AccuracyCalculator . This will be used to compute the accuracy of your model. By default, AccuracyCalculator is used. visualizer : Optional. An object that has implemented the fit_transform method, as done by UMAP and many scikit-learn functions. For example, you can set visualizer = umap.UMAP() . The object's fit_transform function should take in a 2D array of embeddings, and reduce the dimensionality, such that calling visualizer.fit_transform(embeddings) results in a 2D array of size (N, 2). visualizer_hook : Optional. This function will be passed the following args. You can do whatever you want in this function, but the reason it exists is to allow you to save a plot of the embeddings etc. visualizer: The visualizer object that you passed in. embeddings: The dimensionality reduced embeddings. label: The corresponding labels for each embedding. split_name: The name of the split (train, val, etc.) keyname: The name of the dictionary key where the embeddings and labels are stored. epoch: The epoch for which the embeddings are being computed.

This is probably the tester you are looking for. To see it in action, check one of the example notebooks testers . GlobalEmbeddingSpaceTester ( * args , ** kwargs ) WithSameParentLabelTester \u00b6 This assumes there is a label hierarchy. For each sample, the search space is narrowed by only looking at sibling samples, i.e. samples with the same parent label. For example, consider a dataset with 4 fine-grained classes {cat, dog, car, truck}, and 2 coarse-grained classes {animal, vehicle}. The nearest neighbor search for cats and dogs will consist of animals, and the nearest-neighbor search for cars and trucks will consist of vehicles. testers .

The default is None, meaning PCA will not be applied. data_device : Which gpu to use for the loaded dataset samples. If None, then the gpu or cpu will be used (whichever is available). dtype : The type that the dataset output will be converted to, e.g. torch.float16 .

Labels can be integers or strings. This option needs to be specified only if set_min_label_to_zero is True. set_min_label_to_zero : If True, labels will be mapped such that they represent their rank in the label set. For example, if your dataset has labels 5, 10, 12, 13, then at each iteration, these would become 0, 1, 2, 3. You should also set this to True if you want to use string labels.

An object that extends AccuracyCalculator . This will be used to compute the accuracy of your model. By default, AccuracyCalculator is used. visualizer : Optional. An object that has implemented the fit_transform method, as done by UMAP and many scikit-learn functions. For example, you can set visualizer = umap.UMAP() . The object's fit_transform function should take in a 2D array of embeddings, and reduce the dimensionality, such that calling visualizer.fit_transform(embeddings) results in a 2D array of size (N, 2). visualizer_hook : Optional. This function will be passed the following args. You can do whatever you want in this function, but the reason it exists is to allow you to save a plot of the embeddings etc. visualizer: The visualizer object that you passed in. embeddings: The dimensionality reduced embeddings. label: The corresponding labels for each embedding. split_name: The name of the split (train, val, etc.) keyname: The name of the dictionary key where the embeddings and labels are stored. epoch: The epoch for which the embeddings are being computed.

The base class does not require any specific keys. For example, you could provide an empty dictionary, in which case no optimization will happen. Or you could provide just an optimizer for your trunk_model. But most likely, you'll want to pass in: {\"trunk_optimizer\": trunk_optimizer, \"embedder_optimizer\": embedder_optimizer}. batch_size : The number of elements that are retrieved at each iteration. loss_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to loss functions. The required keys depend on the training method, but all methods are likely to require at least: {\"metric_loss\": loss_func}. dataset : The dataset you want to train on. Note that training methods do not perform validation, so do not pass in your validation or test set. mining_funcs : A dictionary mapping strings to mining functions. Pass in an empty dictionary, or one or more of the following keys: {\"subset_batch_miner\": mining_func1, \"tuple_miner\": mining_func2} data_device : The device that you want to put batches of data on. If not specified, the trainer will put the data on any available GPUs. dtype : The type that the dataset output will be converted to, e.g. torch.float16 . If set to None , then no type casting will be done. iterations_per_epoch : Optional. If you don't specify iterations_per_epoch : 1 epoch = 1 pass through the dataloader iterator. If sampler=None , then 1 pass through the iterator is 1 pass through the dataset. If you use a sampler, then 1 pass through the iterator is 1 pass through the iterable returned by the sampler. For samplers like MPerClassSampler or some offline mining method, the iterable returned might be very long or very short etc, and might not be related to the length of the dataset. The length of the epoch might vary each time the sampler creates a new iterable. In these cases, it can be useful to specify iterations_per_epoch so that each \"epoch\" is just a fixed number of iterations. The definition of epoch matters because there's various things like LR schedulers and hooks that depend on an epoch ending. loss_weights : A dictionary mapping loss names to numbers. Each loss will be multiplied by the corresponding value in the dictionary. If not specified, then no loss weighting will occur. If not specified, then the original labels are used. sampler : The sampler used by the dataloader. If not specified, then random sampling will be used. collate_fn : The collate function used by the dataloader. lr_schedulers : A dictionary of PyTorch learning rate schedulers. Your keys should be strings of the form <model>_<step_type> , where <model> is a key that comes from either the models or loss_funcs dictionary, and <step_type> is one of the following: \"scheduler_by_iteration\" (will be stepped at every iteration) \"scheduler_by_epoch\" (will be stepped at the end of each epoch) \"scheduler_by_plateau\" (will step if accuracy plateaus. This requires you to write your own end-of-epoch hook, compute validation accuracy, and call trainer.step_lr_plateau_schedulers(validation_accuracy) . Or you can use HookContainer .) Here are some example valid lr_scheduler keys: trunk_scheduler_by_iteration metric_loss_scheduler_by_epoch embedder_scheduler_by_plateau gradient_clippers : A dictionary of gradient clipping functions. Each function will be called before the optimizers. freeze_these : Optional. A list or tuple of the names of models or loss functions that should have their parameters frozen during training. These models will have requires_grad set to False, and their optimizers will not be stepped. freeze_trunk_batchnorm : If True, then the BatchNorm parameters of the trunk model will be frozen during training. label_hierarchy_level : If each sample in your dataset has multiple labels, then this integer argument can be used to select which \"level\" to use. This assumes that your labels are \"2-dimensional\" with shape (num_samples, num_hierarchy_levels). Leave this at the default value, 0, if your data does not have multiple labels per sample. dataloader_num_workers : The number of processes your dataloader will use to load data. data_and_label_getter : A function that takes the output of your dataset's __getitem__ function, and returns a tuple of (data, labels). If None, then it is assumed that __getitem__ returns (data, labels). dataset_labels : The labels for your dataset. Can be 1-dimensional (1 label per datapoint) or 2-dimensional, where each row represents a datapoint, and the columns are the multiple labels that the datapoint has. Labels can be integers or strings. This option needs to be specified only if set_min_label_to_zero is True. set_min_label_to_zero : If True, labels will be mapped such that they represent their rank in the label set. For example, if your dataset has labels 5, 10, 12, 13, then at each iteration, these would become 0, 1, 2, 3. You should also set this to True if you want to use string labels. In that case, 'dog', 'cat', 'monkey' would get mapped to 1, 0, 2. If True, you must pass in dataset_labels (see above). The default is False. end_of_iteration_hook : This is an optional function that has one input argument (the trainer object), and performs some action (e.g. logging data) at the end of every iteration. Here are some things you might want to log: trainer.losses : this dictionary contains all loss values at the current iteration. trainer.loss_funcs and trainer.mining_funcs : these dictionaries contain the loss and mining functions. Some loss and mining functions have attributes called _record_these or _record_these_stats . These are lists of names of other attributes that might be useful to log. (The list of attributes might change depending on the value of COLLECT_STATS .) For example, the _record_these_stats list for BaseMiner is [\"num_pos_pairs\", \"num_neg_pairs\", \"num_triplets\"] , so at each iteration you could log the value of trainer.mining_funcs[\"tuple_miner\"].num_pos_pairs . To accomplish this programmatically, you can use record-keeper . Or you can do it yourself: first check if the object has _record_these or _record_these_stats , and use the python function getattr to retrieve the specified attributes. If you want ready-to-use hooks, take a look at the logging_presets module . end_of_epoch_hook : This is an optional function that operates like end_of_iteration_hook , except this occurs at the end of every epoch, so this might be a suitable place to run validation and save models. To end training early, your hook should return the boolean value False. Note, it must specifically return False , not None , 0 , [] etc. For this hook, you might want to access the following dictionaries: trainer.models , trainer.optimizers , trainer.lr_schedulers , trainer.loss_funcs , and trainer.mining_funcs .

class SmoothAP(torch.nn.Module):
    """PyTorch implementation of the Smooth-AP loss.

    implementation of the Smooth-AP loss. Takes as input the mini-batch of CNN-produced feature embeddings and returns
    the value of the Smooth-AP loss. The mini-batch must be formed of a defined number of classes. Each class must
    have the same number of instances represented in the mini-batch and must be ordered sequentially by class.

    e.g. the labels for a mini-batch with batch size 9, and 3 represented classes (A,B,C) must look like:

        labels = ( A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C)

    (the order of the classes however does not matter)

    For each instance in the mini-batch, the loss computes the Smooth-AP when it is used as the query and the rest of the
    mini-batch is used as the retrieval set. The positive set is formed of the other instances in the batch from the
    same class. The loss returns the average Smooth-AP across all instances in the mini-batch.

    Args:
        anneal : float
            the temperature of the sigmoid that is used to smooth the ranking function. A low value of the temperature
            results in a steep sigmoid, that tightly approximates the heaviside step function in the ranking function.
        batch_size : int
            the batch size being used during training.
        num_id : int
            the number of different classes that are represented in the batch.
        feat_dims : int
            the dimension of the input feature embeddings

    Shape:
        - Input (preds): (batch_size, feat_dims) (must be a cuda torch float tensor)
        - Output: scalar

    Examples::

        >>> loss = SmoothAP(0.01, 60, 6, 256)
        >>> input = torch.randn(60, 256, requires_grad=True).cuda()
        >>> output = loss(input)
